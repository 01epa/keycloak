         In some of the example listings, what is meant to be displayed on one line does not fit
         inside the available page width. These lines have been broken up. A '\' at the end of a
         line means that a break has been introduced to fit in the page, with the following lines
         indented. So:
         <programlisting>
            Let's pretend to have an extremely \
            long line that \
            does not fit
            This one is short
         </programlisting>
