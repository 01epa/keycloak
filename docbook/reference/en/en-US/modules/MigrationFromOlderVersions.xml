                There is a new credential type "secret".  Unlike other credential types, it is stored in plain text in
                the database and can be viewed in the admin console.

                There is no longer required Application or OAuth Client credentials.  These client types are now
                hard coded to use the "secret" credential type.

            <listitem>
                Because of the "secret" credential change to Application and OAuth Client, you'll have to update
                your keycloak.json configuration files and regenarate a secret within the Application or OAuth Client
                credentials tab in the administration console.
