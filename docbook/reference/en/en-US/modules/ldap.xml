    <title>LDAP Integration</title>
    <para>
        Right now, LDAP server is configured separately for each Realm. Configuration is in admin console in tab <literal>Ldap</literal>
        under realm settings. It's under URL like <ulink url="http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/keycloak-admin/console/index.html#/realms/YOUR_REALM/ldap-settings">http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/keycloak-admin/console/index.html#/realms/YOUR_REALM/ldap-settings</ulink> .
        There is nothing like "shared" LDAP server for more realms in Keycloak, but it's planned for the future.

        LDAP is currently used just for authentication of users done through <literal>PicketlinkAuthenticationProvider</literal> as described <link linkend="authentication-available-providers">here</link> .
        In the future, we have plan to have full Sync SPI, which will allow one-way or two-way synchronization between LDAP server and Keycloak database including users and roles.
